# CSharp-SortingAlgorithms
### A small project to visualize sorting algorithms implemented in C# using WPF.

The application contains the following algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Cycle Sort
- Heap Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Shell Sort

In the APP folder you can execute the SortingAlgorithms.exe file to test the application (You **need** to have Visual Studio 2022 installed or the DLLs for the .exe to run).

A project inspired by [https://panthema.net/2013/sound-of-sorting/].

**Disclaimer:** The code developed is by no means optimized and using the "best-practices" since this project was made for fun and with the objective to learn and improve.
