# CSharp-SortingAlgorithms
A list of sorting algorithms implemented in C# using WPF(*).



In the APP folder you can execute the SortingAlgorithms.exe file to test the application (You NEED to have Visual Studio 2022 installed or the DLLs for the app to run).

A project inspired by [(https://panthema.net/2013/sound-of-sorting/)].
